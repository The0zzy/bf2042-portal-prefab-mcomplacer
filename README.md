# MCOM Placement Utility

Play Bob the Builder in this utility and gather your mcom placement coordinates easily in-game. 

Use the wrench to rotate the MCOM clockwise and the repair tool to rotate it anti-clockwise. To reset an mcom rotation - crouch.

The interact key prints the placement info in the error log and switches to the next mcom.
